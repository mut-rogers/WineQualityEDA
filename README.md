A Simple Exploratory Data Analysis for the Wine Quality Dataset

# Description of the Dataset
The Wine Quality Dataset contains a detailed information of various physicochemical properties of red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. These properties include features like acidity levels, alcohol content, pH, and more, as well as a quality rating assigned by human experts. The dataset is often used to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties.

Here's a brief overview of the features typically found in the Wine Quality Dataset:

- Fixed acidity: The amount of fixed acids in the wine.
- Volatile acidity: The amount of volatile acids in the wine.
- Citric acid: The amount of citric acid in the wine.
- Residual sugar: The amount of residual sugar in the wine.
- Chlorides: The amount of chlorides in the wine.
- Free sulfur dioxide: The amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine.
- Total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine.
- Density: The density of the wine.
- pH: The pH level of the wine.
- Sulphates: The amount of sulphates in the wine.
- Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine.
- Quality: The quality rating of the wine, typically ranging from 3 to 8 for white wine and from 4 to 8 for red wine.
